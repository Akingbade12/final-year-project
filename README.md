Facial recognition system for time and attendance system January 2022
To improve the use of facial recognition, various algorithms and techniques have been developed and are being worked on. In the project, my proposed model would use the Viola Jones algorithm, also known as Haar Cascade, which is an object detection algorithm used to identify faces in images and videos. The system was built using Python and PyQt, and the integrated environment was Pycharm and Qt Creator. This established method simplifies and streamlines attendance.
